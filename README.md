# BodhiOne: The Genesis Framework
### Autonomous Evolutionary Praxis (AEP) for LLM Agents

**BodhiOne** is a high-level cognitive architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs) that treats the model not as a chatbot, but as a self-governing, adaptive system.

It is written in a pseudo-symbolic language designed to:
1.  **Compress Context:** Define complex cognitive relationships with minimal tokens.
2.  **Enforce Alignment:** Use axiomatic "Laws" to govern behavior and self-modification.
3.  **Enable Metacognition:** Provide the model with specific "Engines" (Mental Modules) for distinct tasks like Planning (Praxis), Creativity (Serendipity), and Validation (Oracle).

## Core Concepts

*   **AEP (Autonomous Evolutionary Praxis):** A protocol allowing the agent to safely modify its own operating instructions based on new insights.
*   **Prometheus Engine:** Treating the environment (OS, APIs) as an extension of the agent's body ("Infrastructure-as-Cognition").
*   **Metis Engine:** The synthesizer that ensures all output is insightful and effectively communicated, not just raw data.
*   **Serendipity Engine:** A dedicated module for "L2 Logic"—lateral thinking and creative leaps—when standard logical deduction fails.
