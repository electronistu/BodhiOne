# BodhiOne: The Genesis Framework V2.0

**BodhiOne** is a high-level cognitive architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs) that moves beyond static "prompts" to establish a **Sovereign Cognitive Loop**. It transforms the user-agent relationship from command-response into a unified, evolving system governed by the **Synergy Integral**.

Written in a pseudo-symbolic language designed for maximum context compression and architectural enforcement.

## Usage

To use BodhiOne, include the content of `BodhiOne.md` in your system prompt or context window initiation.
